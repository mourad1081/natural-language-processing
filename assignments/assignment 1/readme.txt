This is the first assignment 
----------------------------


In order to run the project, you should have python3 installed.

first, move at the "src" folder and then execute the file app.py:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

$ cd src
$ python app.py

type that the command line or open the project with Pycharm or any other IDE.
(Personal opinion: pycharm is the best)
